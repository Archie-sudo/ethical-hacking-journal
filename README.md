Ethical Hacking Journal

A hands-on journey into cybersecurity mastery — from reconnaissance to red teaming.

🚀 About This Project

This repository documents my daily ethical hacking practice, blending real-world cybersecurity techniques with structured note-taking. Each folder contains scripts, notes, and documented exploits from controlled lab environments (Metasploitable, Kali Linux, etc.) — strictly for educational and lawful purposes.

My approach:

🛠 Bash + Python automation for penetration testing workflows

📓 Structured documentation for repeatable processes

🕵️ Reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation in safe labs

🔐 Focus on system hardening and defensive countermeasures

📂 Repository Structure

Notes/ – Detailed daily logs and study notes

bash-scripts/ – Custom scripts for system information gathering, automation, and recon

exploits/ – Exploit dev scripts (Python) used in controlled labs

tools/ – Custom scanners, fuzzers, parsers

.gitignore – Keeps unnecessary files out of version control

README.md – This file

🧠 Current Skill Set

Programming: Python, Bash scripting

Cybersecurity Tools: Nmap, Metasploit, Hydra, Wireshark

Operating Systems: Kali Linux, Ubuntu, Windows

Networking: TCP/IP, firewalls, proxychains, Tor routing

Practices: Recon, exploitation, privilege escalation, system hardening

📈 Progress Tracker

Practicing and documenting every day

Building and refining scripts for automation and security tasks

Testing skills on safe, legal environments (CTFs, labs)

Expanding knowledge in Linux, networking, and exploit development

Strengthening Python and Bash scripting for hacking tasks

🚧 Upcoming – Privilege escalation labs, web app pentesting

⚠ Disclaimer

All scripts and techniques here are for educational purposes only in legal, controlled environments. Unauthorized access to systems you don’t own or have explicit permission for is illegal.
