# ethical-hacking-journal
 

This is my personal learning journal as I learn ethical hacking as an intermediate  using Python and Bash. 

## Structure
- `bash-scripts/` → Shell scripts I write while learning Bash
- `python-scripts/` → Python tools I build myself
- `notes/` → Daily logs, reflections, and concepts I learned
