Welcome to my personal ethical hacking journey, logged day by day with scripts, notes, and real-world exploits.

## ðŸ—‚ Structure

- `notes/`: Daily notes and reflections
- `exploits/`: Exploit dev scripts (Python mostly)
- `tools/`: Custom tools like scanners, fuzzers, parsers

## ðŸ”’ Goal

To become a fully hands-on ethical hacker by building, not just copying.

## ðŸ“… Journal Timeline

Stay tuned.
