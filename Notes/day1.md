# Day 1 — Getting Started with Bash and Ethical Hacking Journal

## Focus
Initialized the Ethical Hacking Journal repository structure and began basic Bash scripting practice.

## Key Learnings
- Repository structure:  
  - `bash-scripts/` for Linux & Bash scripting practice  
  - `notes/` for daily reflections and learnings  
  - `exploits/` for Python exploit development  
  - `tools/` for custom hacking tools
- Basic Bash commands for file navigation, permissions, and process management.
- First script: A simple system info extractor.

## Reflection
The journey officially begins. The repo is my logbook — every day counts, no matter how small the progress.
