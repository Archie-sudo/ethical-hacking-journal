# Day 2 — Deep Dive into Bash Scripts

## Focus
Moved from writing basic Bash one-liners to creating well-structured, maintainable scripts.

## Key Skills Learned
- Added professional script headers for readability and documentation.
- Used `set -e` for safe error handling.
- Incorporated ANSI color codes to improve CLI output visibility.
- Designed a script to automate system information gathering.

## Script Summary
The `system_info.sh` script:
1. Prints system hostname, OS, and kernel version.
2. Shows uptime, logged-in users, disk usage, and memory usage.
3. Displays current IP address.
4. Formats output with colors and a clean report layout.

## Reflection
Bash scripting feels less like “typing commands” and more like building reusable hacking tools.  
This is foundational for automation in ethical hacking — especially for recon and system enumeration.
